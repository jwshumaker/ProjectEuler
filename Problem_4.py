A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

    # Now we just return a comparison of the digits to the reversed digits
    # Note that digits[::-1] works because the iterable syntax is [start stop step]
    return digits == digits[::-1]
